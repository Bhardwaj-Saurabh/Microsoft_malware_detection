# Problem Statement
The malware industry continues to be a well-organized, well-funded market dedicated to evading traditional security measures. Once a computer is infected by malware, criminals can hurt consumers and enterprises in many ways.

With more than one billion enterprise and consumer customers, Microsoft takes this problem very seriously and is deeply invested in improving security.

As one part of their overall strategy for doing so, Microsoft is challenging the data science community to develop techniques to predict if a machine will soon be hit with malware. Microsoft is providing Kagglers with an unprecedented malware dataset to encourage open-source progress on effective techniques for predicting malware occurrences.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to predict a Windows machineâ€™s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. 

# Data Description
The dataset used in this project is provided by Microsidft. Although, it contains almost 4 millions records based on 83 different features, due to system capacity, I have used 1 millions records to complete this project. Some of the import features in the dataset are based on App version, Windows Version, Anti-virus Version, Operating System, Storage, Display used, and RAM used in the machines. The dataset is publicly available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). 

The dataset has two different classes in target column and is balanced, with 500000 samples for each class, and contains missing or null values. It is considered a chellenging project in machine learning and data science community for tasks such as classification, clustering, and feature selection.

## Data Preprocessing:
For this project, the data was prepared by removing features with zero standard deviation and more than 90% missing values and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets using a 75/25 split ratio. To improve the model performance, some features based on App version, Windows Version, Anti-virus Version, Operating System, Storage, Display used, and RAM were also engineered and added to the dataset. Except missing values treatment, no further data scalling or preprocessing were required as the dataset is well-structured.
